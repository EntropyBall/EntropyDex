## How to use the app

## How the app is made 
### useContext Hook
Form are store in Map for better performance (adding/removing)
To keep track of pokemon form (lucky, shiny, shadow...) useContext is implemented:
- it avoids passing prop drilling from App > PokemonItem > PokemonCard
- allows each PokemonItem component to set the map
- every change on the map reload the every component (?)
