Used for rendering different JSX
Â¿ Can be used for PokemonItem forms ?

## How to use the app

## App architecture

Array of map is load for one user
Components' tree
- App
  - NavBar
    - NavButton
    - NavList
      - NavItem
  - PokemonItem
    - PokemonCard
      - PokemonFormBar
        - ShinyBaseIcon/ShinyActiveIcon
        - LuckyBaseIcon/LuckyActiveIcon
      - PokemonTitle
      - PokemonImage
        - LazyLoadImage
## Hooks
### useContext Hook
Form are store in Map for better performance (adding/removing)
Form default value is an empty Map() to avoir error if context is not provided.
To keep track of pokemon form (lucky, shiny, shadow...) useContext is implemented:
- it avoids passing prop drilling from App > PokemonItem > PokemonCard
- allows each PokemonItem component to set the map
- since it's not a state React doesn't re-render every component.

Changing account in the <NavItem /> will trigger a re-render of every component _'for the first time'_ since the account context is placed at the top level component <App /> and is assigned as a state.
To change that I need to use a shouldComponentUpdate equivalent in React 18: useMemo or useCallback

### memo (not working)
Switching between accounts re-renders every image component. Since the images are the same no matter what, there is no need to re-render those components every time.
By preventing re-render every image, memo improves performance.
