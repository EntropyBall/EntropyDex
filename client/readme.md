Used for rendering different JSX
Â¿ Can be used for PokemonItem forms ?
## How to use the app

## App architecture

Array of map is load for one user

### useContext Hook
Form are store in Map for better performance (adding/removing)
To keep track of pokemon form (lucky, shiny, shadow...) useContext is implemented:
- it avoids passing prop drilling from App > PokemonItem > PokemonCard
- allows each PokemonItem component to set the map
- every change on the map reload the every component (?)

### memo
Switching between accounts re-renders every image component. Since the images are the same no matter what, there is no need to re-render those components every time.
By preventing re-render every image, memo improves performance.
